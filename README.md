# NLP QA Project with LLama 3.2 1B & GPT2 Large

## Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a Question-Answering (QA) system using the LLama 3.2 1B & GPT2 Large model. By leveraging state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, we aim to provide accurate and efficient answers to user queries based on a dataset from Hugging Face.

## Dataset
We utilize a QA dataset sourced from Hugging Face. The dataset has been carefully chosen to ensure its quality and relevance to the project. It contains:
- Questions: Diverse types of questions, including factual, conceptual, and open-ended.
- Contexts: Supporting passages or documents from which the answers can be derived.
- Answers: Ground truth labels for supervised training.

## Model
We have selected the LLama 3.2 1B & GPT2 Large model for this project due to its:
- High performance in NLP tasks.
- Ability to handle large-scale QA datasets effectively.
- Flexibility in fine-tuning for domain-specific use cases.

## Project Objectives
1. Fine-tune LLama 3.2 1B on the QA dataset to improve its performance.
